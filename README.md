This is a simple print for storing a revo nozzle. The sleeve is press-fit into the hexagonal skirt. On the V0.2 the amount of space behind will depend on your wiring. I can fit up to 10.

CAD/STL has since been updated, nozzle now sits a bit deeper in the holder and added more chamfers.

These dimensions got me a reasonably good press-fit in the skirt. Feel free to request any modified dimensions and I can add variations.
