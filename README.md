~ printed with 0.6mm nozzle / 0.2mm layer height. Please excuse the filthy nozzles

This is a simple print for storing a revo nozzle. The sleeve is press-fit into the hexagonal skirt. On the V0.2 the amount of space behind will depend on your wiring. I can fit up to 10.

CAD/STL has since been updated, nozzle now sits a bit deeper in the holder and added more chamfers.
Orient model with the opening on the build plate. After printing, insert a nozzle and whilst pushing it in gently, turn it clockwise. The nozzle will cut its own shallow threads in the holder, allowing it to hold the nozzle securely without the risk of it falling out. Simply unscrew to remove.

These dimensions got me a reasonably good press-fit in the skirt. Feel free to request any modified dimensions and I can add variations.
