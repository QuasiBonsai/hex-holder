~ printed with 0.6mm nozzle / 0.15mm layer height.

This is a fairly simple print for storing a revo nozzle. The sleeve is press-fit into the hexagonal skirt. On the V0.2 the amount of space behind will depend on your wiring, but there should be room for at least 3-4 of these if you wanted.

CAD/STL has been updated, nozzle now sits a bit deeper in the holder and added more chamfers.
These dimensions got me a reasonably good press-fit in the skirt. Feel free to request any modified dimensions and I can add variations.
